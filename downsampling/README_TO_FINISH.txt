## Downsampling analysis ##
###########################

The aim of the downsampling analysis is to show that having an incomplete data set gives you more power than having a complete data set removing the partially unobserved samples.

Methodology:
We start from the completely observed samples (N) and we downsample from i=1 to N-x samples, either removing all views or just a random subset. Repeat every i for K times


Plots:
- Reconstruction of IGHV and trisomy 12
- Imputation
- Robustness of factors

The aim of this analysis is to show the imputation results for an example drug in the following scenarios:

- Mask 10 patients, 5 U-IGHV and 5 M-IGHV.
M: H050, H235, H022, H170, H236
U: H042, H164, H085, H252, H211

- Which drugs??
D_078_3, D_078_2
D_020_2, D_020_3
D_017_1, D_017_2, D_017_3
D_050_2, D_050_3
D_077_2

- Compare the following models:
	Mean imputation
	MOFA with assay missing
	MOFA with drug missing
